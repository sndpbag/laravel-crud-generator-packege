## Coding Standards

### PHP Code Style

We follow **PSR-12** coding standards. Please ensure your code adheres to these standards.

**Key Points:**
- Use 4 spaces for indentation (no tabs)
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add type hints for parameters and return types
- Write clear and concise comments
- Follow Laravel naming conventions

**Example:**
```php
<?php

namespace Sndpbag\CrudGenerator\Generators;

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\File;

class ExampleGenerator extends BaseGenerator
{
    public function generate(): array
    {
        // Implementation
        return [
            'success' => true,
            'path' => $path
        ];
    }
}
```

### Naming Conventions

- **Classes:** PascalCase (e.g., `ModelGenerator`)
- **Methods:** camelCase (e.g., `generateModel()`)
- **Variables:** camelCase (e.g., `$modelName`)
- **Constants:** UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `DEFAULT_PATH`)
- **Files:** PascalCase for classes, snake_case for configs

### Documentation

- Add PHPDoc blocks for all classes and methods
- Explain complex logic with inline comments
- Update README for new features

**Example:**
```php
/**
 * Generate model file
 *
 * @return array Returns array with success status and file path
 */
public function generate(): array
{
    // Implementation
}
```

## Pull Request Process
